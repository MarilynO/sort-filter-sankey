- the problem is somewhere in the sorting of d3.chart.sankey.min.js
- solution(?): modify d3.chart.sankey.min.js so that it doesnt sort the data
- what this means? can't use cdn, will have to use custom modified javascript file
- filter & sorting: this will be done independent of the charts by buttons on the page
  - sort/filter data on click of button
  - pass data to chart function to re-paint
- data manipulation might be tricky
  - load in a csv and format it to json?

- tool tip sorting(?): on hover functionality is also in d3.chart.sankey.min.js

MOVING FORWARD:
- does the sankey chart do any sorting?
    - frequency ('value')
    - alphabetical
    -ANSWER: the chart is displayed by how the data is input in the nodes array and its corresponding paths in links. the format of json displayed is a node and all of its children
- finish algorithm converting csv data to filterable json data.
